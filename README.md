# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
"# Web_AI_Travel_Planner" 


To run :

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

- `.env.local` file:
```plaintext
VITE_GOOGLE_PLACE_API_KEY = "google_place_api"

VITE_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY = "gemini_api"

VITE_GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "auth_client_id"
```

- In this project I have not used the `Google Place API` so, make sure you use it and I have added static images in the place of `google api images`.

- If you have `Google Place API` use tha one and uncomment the code which are commented.

- And Edit the code according to your needs
